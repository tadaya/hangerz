#Hangerz

*** IN DEVELOPMENT ***


## Project Description
Hangerz is a personal wardrobe organizing app to help users organize their clothing, shoes, and accessories. Users upload photos of their clothes or link to pictures online (from online retailers, online fashion blogs, etc). Hangerz presents users' wardrobes similarly to an online retailer, so that users' possesions are not only organized but appealing as well. 

Users have the option to add details about their possesions such as size, brand, price, etc. Users can also leave notes about thier possesion and tie their possesion to physical places such as "closet" or "bottom drawer" or "cleaners."

Hangerz is being built as project for a General Assembly course. My goal for this project was to get a better handle on JavaScript frameworks, in this case Backbone.

## Technologies/Frameworks/Libraries Used:
  * Ruby on Rails
  * Javascript
  * Backbone.js
  * Underscore.js
  * CoffeeScript
